# Manifold Solidify
A Solidify Addon for Blender which makes good topology and avoids intersections

This was a prototype for the nonmanifold solidify modifier in blender. Since 2.82 the solidify modifier is extended to have this functionallity under the name of Complex Solidify (https://developer.blender.org/D5766). All the countless bugs from this script are fixed in that final version. This script also contains an algorithm to remove intersections in most cases, the official solidify modifier does not support that yet.
